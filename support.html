                                        <p> ODIME works with many Mason entities and students to foster and sustain an inclusive and culturally aware campus. Various student communities - such as <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/org/apac/">Asian-Pacific American Coalition (APAC)</a>, Hispanic Latino Leadership Association (HLLA), Queer Trans People of Color (QTPOC), and the Black Leadership Roundtable (BLR) of Black Mason - often times find support and advising in this office.</p>
                                        <p> A great thing about ODIME is that it operates as a hangout space for many LGBTQ+ people and POC who need somewhere to decompress and feel understood. Also, many of the faculty and students here are usually equipped to understand the challenges and joys that come with our identities, so you can definetly find a listening, supportive ear here. </p>

                                    <p>Mental health is becoming more and more important in the black community. CAPS serves as an entry point for students to acquire off-campus services with their insurance and/or <b>FREE</b> on-campus psychological services by quality-trained counselors and clinicians. <b>Everything is confidential, so only you and your counselor will know what you discuss</b> </p>
                                    <p>Some great services include group therapy, workshops, psychiatric evaluations, and online self-help - fight the stigma against mental health and take advantage of these services. Also, try out the <a href="https://caps.gmu.edu/mindspa/">MindSpa</a>, a relaxation room with essential oils, music, and a massage chair to destress after a long week. </p>

The office connects students with appropriate Mason and off-campus resources and implements action plans for students in need of intervention, including crisis intervention. Please contact SSAC if you observe behavior that causes concern about a student or other community member’s safety, feel threatened by a student or otherwise notice behavior changes in a student that cause concern.</p>
